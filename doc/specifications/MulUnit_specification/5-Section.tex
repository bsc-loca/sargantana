\section{Reset and Kill behaviour}

The reset signal \textit{rstn\_i} works on a negative edge.
All the outputs will be 0 and if some operation is being executed, it will be stopped.

Similarly kill signal (\textit{kill\_mul\_i}) is used when the control unit needs to flush an operation inside the \textit{mul\_unit} module.  Signal \textit{stall\_o} and \textit{result\_o} will be set to 0 immediately.
