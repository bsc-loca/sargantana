\section{What could not happen}

\begin{itemize}
    \item If \textit{request\_i} is 1 (means that the module should start computing) and \textit{int\_32\_i} is 0, \textit{func3\_i} should take a value between 000 and 011, higher values are invalid.
    \item \textit{stall\_i} and \textit{done\_tick\_i} can not be 1 at the same time.
\end{itemize}
