\section{What could not happen}

The Control Unit is a combinational block and accept all combinations of the inputs.
The module should handle all the possible combinations of inputs given priority to some of them.
For example, if the execution stage is blocked and the write back stage commits a mispredicted branch, it should give priority to the write back stage.
