\textit{Person in Charge; Guillem L\'opez}

The Control Unit module is placed in the datapath module alongside the stages of the pipeline.
It is responsible of producing the necessary signals to control the stages and the caches.

This module receives signals from the different stages and the caches, and it outputs the following signals:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Stall the stages when something blocks the pipeline.
    \item Flush the stages when something invalidates the instructions in the pipeline.
    \item Select the next PC to be fetched.
    \item Invalidate the cache requests.
    \item Write into the register bank.
\end{itemize}
