\section{General purpose of the module}
\textit{Person in Charge; Guillem Lopez Paradis}

The datapath module connects all the stages of the pipeline through registers.
\begin{itemize}
	\item It connects the output signals of each stage to a register to save the state at every cycle.
	\item It connects the output of the registers to the next stages: e.g. IF - register - ID
	\item It has the instances of every stage in the pipeline and connect their output to the top.
	\item It has some logic for the CSR. This can be placed in a specific module.
\end{itemize}
