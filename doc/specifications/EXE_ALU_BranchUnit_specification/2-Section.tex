\section{Design placement}
\label{chapter2}

Exe\_stage module should be instantiated on the datapath module, between Read Registers and Write Back stages. All input and output signals of exe\_stage are connected to the datapath module.

ALU module is meant to be placed inside exe\_stage module. There should be only one instance per core. An all signals of the module are connected inside exe\_stage module. 

BU module is meant to be placed inside exe\_stage module. There should be only one instance per core. An all signals of the module are connected inside exe\_stage module.
