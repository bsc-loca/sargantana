\section{What could not happen}

All signals must match in width with other interfaces. Unused signals shall be removed.\\

Writes to register 0 are not forbidden but they shall not take any effect. Therefore register 0 shall remain 0 through all execution.\\

When reading a value, the most updated value of the register shall be forwarded to the output. therefore when a write is ongoing,
and a read to the same register is issued, write data shall be bypassed to the corresponding read port instead of taking the previous value from the register.
