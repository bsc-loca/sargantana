\subsection{Div\_unit}

\begin{itemize}
  \item When \emph{divsr\_i} is zero
  \item Set \emph{int\_32\_i} to 1, while \emph{dvnd\_i} and \emph{dvsr\_i} are set to 64 bit variables.
  \item Examples in which  \emph{dvnd\_i} and \emph{dvsr\_i} have different sign for 32 and 64 bit.
  \item Examples in which \emph{signed\_op\_i} is set and \emph{dvnd\_i} and \emph{dvsr\_i} have negative sign.
\end{itemize}
