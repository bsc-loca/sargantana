The \textit{Instruction Cache Interface} module is placed in the top module alongside the datapath and the Data Cache Interface.
It is responsible of producing the necessary signals to control the instruction cache.

This module receives signals from the datapath and the response from the instruction cache, and it outputs the following signals:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Request to instruction cache.
    \item Response to the CPU.
\end{itemize}
