The \textit{Data Cache Interface} module is placed in the top module alongside the datapath and the Instruction Cache Interface.

This module receives signals from the datapath and the response from the data cache, and it outputs the following signals:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Request to data cache.
    \item Response to the CPU.
\end{itemize}
