\section{Reset behavior}

This module only contains continuous assignments and wires among modules, therefore there is no special reset condition. 

All in all is important to highlight that the input reset signal does not follow the name convention of adding \_n for active low signals. Despite that RST and SOFT\_RST signals are active LOW, and they do not need to be inverted when interfacing with other modules.
